# Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis


The task is to analyse the given data and achieve a conclusion what te reasons are of the clints' attrition, using the ETL method.

Looking at the dataset, I had the following hypothesis:

### Hypotesis 1.

The attrition depends on the age of the customer and for how long ther are with the bank.

### Hypotesis 2.

Customer age and the total transaction count have affect on the attrition.

### Hypotesis 3.

Relation among the Marital Status, the Months on Book and Card Category on Attrition Status.

## ETL pipeline

Steps before analysis:

* importing data
* data cleaing
* checking if there is N/A information

## Basic correlation test

Checking how the different data correlate to each other, but mainly to the customer churning.

* Customer Age and Months on book
* Credit Limit,	Total Revolving Balance and 	Total Transaction Amount
* Customer Age,	Months on book and	Dependent count

## Data visualisation

Seeing the charts help the analysis. I tried different charts with different contents. The most useful were the following ones:
